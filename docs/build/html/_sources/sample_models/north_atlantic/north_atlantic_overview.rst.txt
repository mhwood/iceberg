North Atlantic Regional Model
*****************************

Overview
========
This regional model is constructed in the North Atlantic Ocean and encompasses the North 
Atlantic current and the ocean around the Greenland Ice Sheet. This model is constructed according to
the instructions on the `eccoseas <https://eccoseas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ documentation page.
Here, we implement icebergs into this regional-scale model.
