> C------- MW. OPTIONS -------

> C--- Allow reading inidivual size files
> #undef READ_INDIV_SIZE_FILES
> 
> C--- Write out a calving list of all the icebergs that were calved
> C    since the last output (determined by the dump frequency)
> C    This is implemented because the iceberg list only gives a snapshot of
> C    the current icebergs, some of which melt before the next output
> C    if they are very small
> #undef ALLOW_CALVING_OUTPUT
> 
> C--- Allow calving in random size classes
> C    In previous formulation, calving was performed by
> C    selecting the smallest bergs first, which made a lot of 
> C    small bergs at the start of the year. This implemntation
> C    allows the random calving of bergs. A random seed can be 
> C    provided in the data.iceberg file so that results are reprouceable
> #undef ALLOW_RANDOM_CALVING
> 
> C--- Allow calving schedule
> C    This option allows the user to prescribe an individual 
> C    calving schedule for each calving location giving
> C    the time of calving and the size of each berg
> #define ALLOW_CALVING_SCHEDULE
